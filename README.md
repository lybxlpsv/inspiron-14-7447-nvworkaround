# UPDATE : Dell have replaced my laptop mainboard, changing the VRAM from SK Hynix to Micron.
I did not observe any throttling except when running unrealistic load (e.g furmark, kombustor) on the new board. So problem solved I hope, if you do experience throttling with this laptop and still on warranty, do contact dell support.
